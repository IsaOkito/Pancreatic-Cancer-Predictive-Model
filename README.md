# Pancreatic-Cancer-Predictive-Model
This repository contains a machine learning model developed in R to predict pancreatic cancer risk using gene expression data from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus). The model leverages statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze patterns and improve early detection
This model is still under development. It currently has low sensitivity(47%) and low specificity(<50%) , and further improvements are being made to reduce these errors. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
